# Structure a React app: yet another research paper

## Introduction
"Yet another research paper". Sounds really optimistic, doesn't it? 
More rhetorical than a subjective question.
In fact, we can only admit: there is no even an attempt to introduce such
a thing. A pure technical paper that proposes
a methodology of making decision that, ideally, must be accepted 
at very first step, just after receiving the drafts of a design paper. 
Decision of choosing the basis of any system being built: its structure.

Sure, it is possible, so should be proved, that as the result of
the excessive flexibility, so instability of react ecosystem, an engineer
is limited to sets of the decisions which are based on intuitive
and heuristic approaches; therefore, it forces to determine UI/UX 
development as an art of decision making, neither an engineering field.

On the other hand, may we argue with the fact that
problems which we face during react development are technical by its
nature? Even visual design tasks, that somehow look like an artistic,
are being solved by pure engineer techniques. 

Finally, the question raises. Is it possible to accumulate all the 
"intuitive" approaches of building a basis of system and offer 
some rational methods to define the exact (or close to a such)
react app structure? Let's presume to figure it out by starting from
summarizing what are the implicit approaches other researches already
attempted to offer.
